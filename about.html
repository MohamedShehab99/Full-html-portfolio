<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>As a dedicated and hardworking Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Valeo, I am passionate about ensuring excellence in software development processes. Since 2023, I have played a pivotal role in creating and maintaining QA plans that strictly adhere to ASPICE guidelines and Base Practices. My expertise extends to conducting comprehensive work product audits for both internal teams and client deliveries, as well as performing quality audits to confirm adherence to ASPICE standards throughout the development cycle. Beyond traditional QA responsibilities, I bring strong skills in coding and scripting, leveraging Python and JavaScript to develop innovative automation scripts that streamline process audits and enhance overall efficiency. My commitment to continuous improvement and my enthusiasm for web development further enrich my capabilities, enabling me to contribute meaningfully to each project I undertake.</p>
